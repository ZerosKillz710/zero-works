# 👋 Hello, I'm Zero

I'm a self-taught engineer, technician, and team leader with over a decade of hands-on experience in **PCB repair, embedded systems, and industrial control electronics**. While I don't hold a formal degree, my work lives in real-world machines—designed, built, and coded by me, from the ground up.

## 🛠️ What I Do

- 🧠 **Invent, prototype, and code** complete systems using Arduino, C, and Python
- 🔧 **Diagnose & repair complex PCBs**, often down to component level
- 🛜 **Work with CAN Bus** systems in automotive applications
- 📟 **Design and implement embedded control systems**, often for high-reliability industrial equipment
- 📊 **Develop internal tools and automation scripts** for real-world businesses (inventory, diagnostics, UI displays)
- 🧰 **Lead and manage a technical team** (including PhDs) toward successful product launches

## 🧪 Featured Projects
> Due to active NDAs, most of my work cannot be shared publicly, but I’m happy to discuss methodologies and technical challenges I've overcome.

- 💡 Custom-built machine for industrial control testing — **designed, assembled, and coded entirely myself**
- 🌱 Automated greenhouse and curing systems in the cannabis industry
- 🚘 Developed CAN Bus interfaces and signal tools for automotive projects
- 📦 Inventory management application built in Python with Excel backend

## 🧠 Background

- U.S. Navy veteran – **AT (Aviation Electronics Technician)** specializing in guidance systems and black box retrieval  
- Experienced in RF systems, avionics, embedded analog/digital electronics  
- Managed remote operations and hardware manufacturing startups  
- Currently serve as **Manager & Lead Technician** for an industrial control repair facility specializing in safety controls. If you can make it, I can lob a safety grenade at it, and create a solution.
- Former small business owner in chemical supply manufacturing, overseeing everything from synthesis and quality control to packaging and distribution — demonstrating full-stack operational management and safety protocol experience

## 🌱 Self-Driven Learning

- USN technical training, NSGL, N.A.S Pesnacola, Tinker AFB
- certificates in Python, C++, SQL, and Machine Learning *(basic foundation courses)*
- Currently deepening knowledge in **embedded ML, AI edge devices**, and **IC design fundamentals**

## 📫 Let's Connect

While I'm not actively job-seeking, I'm always open to:
- Collaborations
- Mentorship opportunities
- Open-source contributions (non-conflicting with my NDA work)
- Sharing lessons learned in real-world engineering
